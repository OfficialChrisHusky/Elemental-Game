Meeting 09.05.2022:
-In this meeting we talked about the suggestion Chris Made about Magic Circles, a Way of unlocking new abilities using Runes, check
 #gameplay-ideas channel for more info.
-Since the idea way more of a magical thing, and the game is heading in a more Spiritual path, Spencer suggested another idea he mentioned
 in a response to the idea proposed by Chris. Spencer suggested a system where the Player can do a combo by pressing a specific combination
 of keys such as qeq2e1q that would have logical sense, like everytime the conbo ends with a 'q' it throws the thing, if it starts with an 'e'
 it is a movement combo, etc.
-Kai's dog was bothering him
-We then talked about how to balance this combo system and settled on doing it this and then waiting for player feedback to see what needs to
 be changed
-Another thing we talked about was how we need to have achievments for crazy people that try to do stuff like beating the game without taking
 damage, or without using other abilities then the base set, etc
-At the End of the Meeting we discussed tasks for the next week and the tasks are:
    -Chris: Fixing some bugs with the Crafting system, making the Ability Combo Mechanic
    -Denoide: Adding the ability to Place buildings (such as bonfire) into the world
